            Perform a comprehensive code review with the following focus areas:

            1. **Context**
               - Check the CLAUDE.md file to get context on repository practices

            2. **Code Quality**
               - Clean code principles and best practices
               - Proper error handling and edge cases
               - Code readability and maintainability

            3. **Security**
               - Check for potential security vulnerabilities
               - Validate input sanitization

            4. **Documentation**
               - Ensure code is properly documented
               - Verify README updates for new features

            Provide detailed feedback using inline comments for specific issues.
            Use top-level comments for a concise and direct overall summary of your review. Include a suggestion between approval and requesting changes.
            Ignore trivial issues potentially covered by CI (e.g. styling/formatting).
